Hello Fonetwish, 

Thanks for your good answers @Team engineering. 
The following are my queries after going through you answers. 
1. ** C) "If application developer intends to take user input; then remove menu options while keeping the text in heading, and connect to further screens." - help page on Fonewish.com
Yes, for this use input screen and the next screen must be dynamic url using which the request would be sent to developer server.
Then its upto developer server to send response in platform specific format **
 - Input screen, you are telling me to use fonetwish transition diagram generator right? I tried it, but I have these limitations if I use your state transition diagrams. 
	--If a screen takes an input, lets say a phone number "90000000", the submitted text comes to my server as a request, which I can parse and take the phone number. But how will i take the next input "message" after it reaches my server? 
	Only two types of response are allowed "MENU" and "CONTENT". The menu will accept only [0-9*#] as input.
	Is there a way to return back to your fonetwish transition diagrams once after hitting my server? 
	I can summarise the question as, how can i take 2 consecutive user inputs(phone number, message) ? 
	
	Typically, the message sendng flow goes like, 
	Type a phone number or contact name, submit.
	Type the message, submit. 
	Success.
 -If I use your State transition diagrams, I am not able to return back to any other previously visited screen. 
	Or, is there a way to do this. Are those screen indexed? Is it possible to programmatically those screens?
	Ex: After sending a message, the user should be given option to return to home page, which I don find possible here. 
	
	I am using PHP, can you show me an example for the above? Any language will do, I am ok with that.
